# apparel-store-app

This is a simple personal improvment app. I started it to try out some different things with React.js. This is a small part of how I am tyring to redefine myself as a developer.


## Start Up
This is a CRA so simply clone and npm install, and npm start to run the application.

## Current Status
This app is currently being worked on. 

## Tech used
This is mainly a Redux React app currently. 
I will soon throw in some Redux-saga, session storage, more hooks, and GraphQL Applo.
