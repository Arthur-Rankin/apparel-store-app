# apparel-store-app

This is a simple personal improvment app. I started it to try out some different things with React.js. This is a small part of how I am tyring to redefine myself as a developer.


## Dev Environment Start Up
This is a CRA so simply clone and npm install, and npm start to run the application.

There is also a component library server for development that can be ran with npx styleguidist server

## Current Status
This app is deployed at https://arthurs-shop.herokuapp.com/ but is also having features added to it. 

## Tech used
This is mainly a Redux React app currently with Stripe, redux-reselect, and redux-persist. 
I will soon throw in some Redux-saga, some hooks and context to replace some redux actions, and GraphQL Applo.
